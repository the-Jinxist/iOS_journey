## Day 4

5th day of learning.

### Learned
- Auto-layout. Stuff that will let the UI elements on our screen maintain their width, height and position when the screen size or phone orientation changes.
- SizeClasses. Correspond to different iPhone sizes with different resolutions. Instead of designing for each Size class manually, we'll use constraints to make sure each UI element align to different screen sizes.
- Constained splash screen image to screen edges.
- Learnt different ways of embeding views into screens: 
 - Manually dragging the UI element into the view
 - Using the "Editor" tab on the top bar and using the "Embed In" option
 - Using the small arrow-inside-box icon on the debug pane on the bottom.
 - Using AutoLayout. Even thought there's nothing auto about it
 - I understood more the use of contraints and combination of StackViews
 - Completed the Calculator Challenge
