### Learned
- Changed the selected image programmatically on startup

- Worked with observing interactions on UI elemetnts, in this case, a button
- Learnt about working with arrays, variables and constants
- Even saw some nice string interpolation, still a little bit too much code for me though. what happened to a simple `$value` ehn. kini `\(value)`
- Learned about randomization in Swift, and this nifty utility function that allows us to generate a random element from an array `array.randomElement()`
