## Day 0

Unofficial start of the iOS journey. Successfully setup my development environment and had first walk through of the Xcode IDE.

### Learned
- Setting up Xcode
- Starting a new project: as easy as tapping the xcode icon and inputing few details. Adding a team is needed to build the application on to your
  device
- Looked around Storyboard. Learned how to import UI components via the object library
- Learnt out to add images, retrieving the correct dimensions via appicon.co
- Building for first time onto emulator, adjusting build settings as well as selecting target device
- Learnt how to create app icon, which I have to add, is more straightforward that it's android counterpart
