## Day 9

10th day of learning.

### Learned

- Applied MVC to a project all on my lonesome.
- Got familiar with the Brain flow of this iOS application, and also `mutating` functions too
- Fields declared in `Structs` are by default, immutable, to be able to change them, you'll need an immutable function
